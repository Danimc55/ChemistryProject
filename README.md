Hi welcome to my chemistry project. This was i project i had to make for chemistry/programing. It was a shared grade. It has 3 main features: it takes a string and returnes all of the elements in the compount, it returnes the atomic mass for all of the normal elements from 1-8, and it calculates the atomic mass for compounds with those elements. I hope this project comes usefull for your needs.
